While slipping over the blood - depending on your means of transport it goes smoothly or rather clumsily – you notice the small pitter-patter footsteps and a bit farther you see the little boy that lived downstairs.

His Disney T-shirt is covered in so much blood you can barely recognize Elsa from frozen. In his right hand, he’s holding what seems to be a finger. Judging by the elegant ring around the stump, it’s his mother’s…he simply never let go. When he opens his eyes, you can see that they are rolled into the back of his skull. It is clear that this child is no longer among the living. What do you do?</p>
